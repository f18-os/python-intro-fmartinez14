This shell was done with a strong use of the documentation from the OS library in python at:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html

 Uses include the OS.WRONLY and other flags that were used. Similarly, code provided by Dr. Freudenthal was used extensivly to cover the functionality of the shell.
