This shell was done with a strong use of the documentation from the OS library in python at:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html

Uses include the OS.WRONLY and other flags that were used. Furthermore, more uses include os.environ as well as a heavy reference for all calls that used the os library.  Similarly, code provided by Dr. Freudenthal was used extensivly to cover the functionality of the shell. These programs include all the chapter 5 demos including the recently published example #5 that covers piping.

Finally, there was a discussion with two other students, which were as follows:

Stephanie Medina: Regarding I/O redirection and flags/variables.
Brandon Delgado: Regarding the Collaborations.md file for formatting.
